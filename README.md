### Key Points:
- **Minimal HTML**: Markdown avoids any unnecessary HTML tags.
- **Badges**: If you want a PyPI version badge (optional), I included the code for it.

### Steps:
1. Replace the placeholder sections like `some_function()` with actual details about your API.
2. Save this file as `README.md` in your project root.

### After Generating:
1. **Rebuild the package**:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
   
2. **Check the package again with Twine**:
